This part is made by point-and-click and keyboard interaction. &#10;Let’s explain deeper this part:&#10;   - It is represented by an abstract syntax tree, with terminal and non-terminal rules interaction.&#10;   - Terminal and non-terminal rules are represented as text.&#10;- Non-terminal rules are clickable; when the pointer mouse is on a non-terminal rule, a blue box appears and envelop the non-terminal rule; non-terminal that exists and wasn’t clicked, will appear as undefined (colored as red) on the right part of the liss|SDE application. &#10;- Terminal symbols are non-clickable and displayed in bold. &#10;- Some extra informations can appear when you don’t know the meaning of a rule by simply letting your pointer mouse on a rule (do not click on the rule).&#10;- Black dotted boxes are user interaction with the keyboard; a regular expression will be tested after hitting ENTER key on keyboard (Red color means that it is invalid, Green color mean that it is valid).&#10;- Left click on a non-terminal rule, will expand the syntax rule or show a menu with informations; the menu can add, delete or change the rules (depending on the context).&#10;- black tiny arrows will appear to the left of a non-terminal rules and it means that It is possible to hide this rule when clicked (as well as expand it when it is hidden).&#10;&#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" AnchorPane.bottomAnchor="0.0" AnchorPane.leftAnchor="0.0" AnchorPane.rightAnchor="0.0" AnchorPane.topAnchor="0.0" />
