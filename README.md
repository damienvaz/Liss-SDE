# Liss-SDE

In this work, this project aims to develop an editor with the concept of a SDE (Syntax
Directed Editor).

It is intended that the editor works with language designed by the members of the Language
Processing group at University of Minho which is called LISS.
LISS language will be specified with an attribute grammar that will be passed, as input, to
ANTLR. 

The compiler generated by ANTLR will generate MIPS assembly code (lower-level
source code).

The files are available on the Release section.
